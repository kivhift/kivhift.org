A while back, probably while taking a computer graphics class, I stumbled upon
`Craig Reynolds' boids`_. Recently, for some reason, I thought about them again
and decided I needed to implement something. Release the `boids`_!

Just so you know, you can do things like change the number of boids, place an
obstacle in their path, and tweak parameters related to the underlying
algorithm. Type ``?`` for help.
