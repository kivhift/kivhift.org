    <h2>Some background</h2>
    <p>I recently found the implementation of <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's
      Game of Life</a> that I wrote while working through Marijn Haverbeke's
    book <i>Eloquent JavaScript</i>.  I find it strangely calming to set it to
    random and then try and eliminate the whole population while <i>Auto</i> is
    checked.  I decided to post it so that it would be out there, just in case.</p>

    <h2>Use it thusly</h2>
    <p>You can toggle the state of a cell by clicking it.  Select from a few
    initial configurations by using the combo box.  Step through one generation
    by clicking the <i>Tick</i> button.  If <i>Auto</i> is checked, then
    generations are progressed every quarter second.</p>

      <fieldset id="gol-controls">
        <label for="init">Initialization</label>
        <select id="init"></select>
        <button id="tick">Tick</button>
        <input type="checkbox" id="auto">Auto</input>
      </fieldset>
